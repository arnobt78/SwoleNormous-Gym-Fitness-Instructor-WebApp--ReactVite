## Installation & Running Locally

### 1. Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (recommended: latest LTS version)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### 2. Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

```sh
npm run dev
```
Then open your browser to [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)

### 4. (Optional) Build for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### 5. TailwindCSS Setup (Summary)

If you're starting from scratch (not needed for existing clone):

```sh
npm create vite@latest my-project -- --template react
cd my-project
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Then configure `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: { extend: {} },
  plugins: [],
}
```

And add to `src/index.css`:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## Web Worker & Training Logic Mechanism

### How the Training Logic Works

- **Exercise Database:** All exercises are defined in `swoldier.js` with their metadata (muscle groups, equipment, difficulty, description, alternatives).
- **Workout Generator:** The main function in `functions.js` (`generateWorkout`) takes user input (muscles, goal, available equipment) and algorithmically creates a workout routine by:
  - Filtering valid exercises by user context.
  - Assigning compound and accessory exercises.
  - Matching exercise schemes (sets/reps) to the chosen goal (e.g., hypertrophy, strength).
  - Ensuring muscle group coverage and exercise variety.
- **UI Interaction:** In `Generator.jsx`, users select their preferences, then the app displays a generated routine.
- **Teaching Content:** Each exercise includes a description and alternatives, helping users learn proper form and variations.

#### Example (Pseudocode):

```
User selects: Goal = Hypertrophy, Muscle = Chest, Equipment = Bands

1. Filter exercises that target 'chest' and use 'bands'
2. Randomly (but intelligently) mix compound & accessory movements
3. Generate a workout with 5 sets, alternating between types
4. Output: A routine with set/reps, exercise name, and teaching description
```

## Detailed Usage Walkthrough

1. **Open the App:** [Live Demo](https://swolenormous-arnob.netlify.app) or run locally.
2. **Select Muscle Group(s):** Choose from major muscle groups (Chest, Back, Legs, Shoulders, etc.).
3. **Choose Your Goal:** Fat loss, Hypertrophy, Strength, or Skill.
4. **Pick Available Equipment:** Options adapt exercises to your gym/home resources.
5. **Generate Workout:** The app suggests a structured routine, complete with set/rep schemes and exercise descriptions.
6. **View Exercise Details:** Click on exercises to view form tips, substitutions, and teaching notes.
7. **Customize Further:** Rerun the generator or adjust selections for new routines.
